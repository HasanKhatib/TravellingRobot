# TravellingRobot
The adventure of a robot within an empty depressed room! The origin point for the grid is in the bottom left [0,0].

## Summary
This piece of code is a showcase of designing, implementing and testing small programmatic problem! JUnit and Mockito were used to test the functionality, and lombok was used to reduce some Java headache!

## Disclaimer
A fun programming task that took around 90 minutes to build the code with some testing cases! (I spent some more time to tweak the implementation, 60 minutes for first session, and 30 minutes for second one!)
